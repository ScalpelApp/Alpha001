# Alpha001

Original test version of Vuforia - Built with Unity 2017.1.1f1 and JDK 18
I do not think it will be necesary to roll back to these verisons - It is more of a hassel than useful.


The AR tracker is looking for a sheet of QR codes which are saved in the folder.


If it will not build then consider Alpha002!!
Both are essentially teh same with small incremental changes.
